This is a trajectory plotter helper library. It was used to create the plots in
our [2023 ETDP](https://download.tigers-mannheim.de/tdps/2023_ETDP_TIGERs.pdf) and helped during the development of the
overshoot ball interception trajectories.

Have a look at the `drawTrajectories.ipynb` and `createSimulatedGifs.py` files to see how to use this library.
